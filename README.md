ng-lodash
=========

This is a wrapper for the utility library [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/) for Angular JS. One aim for this project is to ensure Lo-Dash doesn't have to be left on the window, and we use Lo-Dash with Angular, in the normal depenedency injection manner.

## Installing

```bower install ngLodash```

After loading Angular

```<script src="ng-lodash.min.js"></script>```
